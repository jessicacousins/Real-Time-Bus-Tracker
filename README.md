# Real Time Bus Tracker

## Description:

The **Real-Time Bus Tracker** is a custom **Google Map** that displays real-time data from the **MBTA** buses. It's created using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **Bootstrap**, **Google Fonts**, and the **Google Maps API**. The map has been customized, linked with the project's ID, and imported into the **Real-Time Bus Tracker**. It displays the buses moving in real-time across their routes. **JavaScript** is used to link the map with the **MBTA** bus data.

## How-to-Run:

_Read through the HTML webpage and add your google maps API key to where it says_ “ADD_API_KEY_HERE”.

## Roadmap of future improvement:

I will update the page's style to match the other projects and add more features. Additionally, I plan to customize the map markers and include a secured API key. For now, users will need to add their own API key.
